# RadiateCodingChallenge
In this project I used the following Libraries: Numpy, urllib and PIL
The Code is documented and I explain each decision in the comments, 
but as an overview I am limited in the amount of random Integers I can 
generate at once so I divided the task into 6 URL Requests in order to 
stay under the 10000 limit each call. I could've done it in 5 Requests but 
this way it allowed me to keep it clean and not have to worry about how many
rows of pixels I would generate each time.
